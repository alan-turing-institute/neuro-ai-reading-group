# neuro-ai-reading-group

## Group description

This is Turing's Neuro-AI reading group where we discuss topics related to the intersection between Neuroscience and AI. 

We meet once every two weeks on Fridays, 2-3pm. Anyone is welcome to suggest a topic to discuss.

The meetings are usually very relaxed, bring anything you'd like to talk about: articles, videos, podcasts, company highlights, etc. 

The group is run by Levan Bokeria <lbokeria@turing.ac.uk>, Balázs Mészáros <bmeszaros@turing.ac.uk>, and Jess Yu <jyu@turing.ac.uk>.
